  Welcome to your Real Estate Manager - <br />
  <br />
  The first step is fleshing out all of the data. Once that is in,
  we can start adding in pretty forms and reports.<br />

  <a href='/agents'>Agents</a><br />
  <a href='/agents'>Listings</a><br />



  For now, we will leave the <a href='admin/'>admin</a> here as a link until
  we can make forms to populate this stuff.
